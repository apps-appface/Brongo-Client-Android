In architecture components,there is no need of creating viewmodel if we dont have to handle screen orienttion. The pattern can implemented using Livedata and repository. Pleae change all files
And now the activity context is binded to the viewmodel which is a wrong way. please change it to application context to avoid memory leaks

please try to do the dependency injection using dagger2
