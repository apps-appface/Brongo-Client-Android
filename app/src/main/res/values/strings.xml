    <!-- Rating Page Content-->
    <string name="understand_your_rating">Ratings allow us to ensure a great experience with Brongo for both broker and client. Just like you rate Broker, broker can rate clients on scale of 1-5 Stars after each connection.</string>
    <string name="how_your_rating">Your rating is an average of the rating you’ve received from brokers, and is measure out of 5 stars. Ratings are anonymous, so neither you nor your broker will ever see an individual rating you’ve received.\nVery few people have a perfect rating. So don’t despair if your average isn’t 5.0. Things that seem small to you can matter to your broker – it’s easy to accidentally be late for a meeting. Knowing a little more about the things that affect a broker’s happiness can help you be a 5-start client.</string>
    <string name="clear_with_requirement">Brokers love when clients are clear with their requirements. Client should know what they want, When they want and where they want</string>
    <string name="qualities">Brokers appreciate those clients who carry below qualities:\n \u2022   Always on time\n \u2022   Great attitude\n \u2022   Organised\n \u2022   Professionalism\n \u2022   Clear about requirement\n \u2022   Open for suggestions\n \u2022   Pay commission on time</string>
    <string name="courtesy">Simple but true – It’s important that client treat broker and their service the way they‘d would expect to be treated themselves. A positive attitude and considerate use of the service go a long way.</string>
    <string name="why_your_rating_matters">Ratings foster mutual respect between brokers and clients. This strengthens our community and helps everyone get the most from Brongo. Just as you expect brokers to treat you with respect, brokers hope to feel the same acknowledgement from clients. A high rating is about more than bragging right among your friends; it’s a sign that people enjoyed their time with you. Keep up the good work.</string>
